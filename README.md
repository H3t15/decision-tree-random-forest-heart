# 🧠 Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forests

This project applies **tree-based machine learning models** to classify the presence of heart disease based on medical attributes. It demonstrates how to train, visualize, and evaluate **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers using Scikit-learn.

---

## 📚 Objective

- Learn how to build and evaluate **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models for classification.
- Understand overfitting and control model complexity using `max_depth`.
- Interpret feature importances and evaluate model performance.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 3
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) *(optional, for visualization)*

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is [`heart.csv`](./heart.csv), which includes 13 features and a binary target (`target`):
- 0 = No heart disease
- 1 = Heart disease present
